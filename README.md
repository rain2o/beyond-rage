Is not well tested. This was quickly built for my wife to use. If others are interested I will improve it over time.

## Use 

Open dndbeyond.com and load a character sheet with Rage.

When you click on one of the Rage uses checkboxes, you will enter Rage Mode. This is indicated by the following:

* A glowing red will pulse around the edges of the window
* Red text "RAGE MODE" will be added to the top of the character sheet.
* Advantage icons will be added to the Strength ability score, Saving Throws, and STR skills.
* A red +{rageBonus} will be added to the weapon damage boxes of all attacks. **This is only cosmetic**, if you roll using DndBeyond dice it will not automatically add the extra bonus.

This mode will persist for each character, allowing you to maintain Rage across sessions. A small button will appear under the Rage uses checkboxes that says "End rage" which will end rage mode.
